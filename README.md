I'm **Bao**, I am projected to graduate in 2027, I hope to get a job in game development. What I like most about programming is the satisfaction of having a working program, it is rewarding like a puzzle. In this next year I hope to improve my skill level with more projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently majoring in Informatics at ASU
- 🤔 I know **Javascript, Java, C++, HTML**
